NOTE:
Hi sir, I was able to complete most questions I selected pretty well however for the the first LOOP question I recieve an error message but it does not clearly state to me what is wrong. Also, in the fifth LOOP question I recieve an error message that I am not sure how to resolve. I checked the answers for help but even putting in what the answers had wrote I could not fix the error. Maybe it has something to do with replit?
I would greatly appreciate some clarification about these two exercises specifically.
Thanks, Ray
